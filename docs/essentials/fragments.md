# Fragments

Fragments are just multiple snippets stored as one. They are stored as tabs within the snippet, and can be completely different langauges or perform completely different tasks. For example, you can have two snippets in two different languages that perform similar functions, stored in one (you can use it for anything else too).

## Creating a Fragment

To create a fragment, either click the **"+"** button in the top right corner of the editor pane, or press <kbd>Cmd+T</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Ctrl+F</kbd> on Windows and Linux.

## Renaming and Deleting Fragments

Bring up the context menu by right-clicking on the fragment and selecting **Rename** or **Delete**.

::: WARNING
A deleted fragment cannot be recovered by any means. Proceed with caution!
