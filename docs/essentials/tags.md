# Tags

Tags are another way to organize your snippets and keep productive.

## Searching for Tagged Snippets

Click on **"TAGS"** besides **"LIBRARY"** in the sidebar to go into tag view mode. Within that, select any tag you want to view snippets in.

## Adding a Tag

Select the snippet to which you want to add a tag, then enter a tag name in the **"Add Tag"** field below the snippet name.

> If a tag already exists, it will be displayed in a pop-up menu from which you can select the tag. Tags are unique and cannot have duplicates.

## Deleting a Tag

Bring up the context menu by right-clicking on the tag and selecting **"Delete"**.

::: NOTE
Deleting a tag does not delete any snippets in it.
