# Folders

massCode allows you to organize your snippets into multi-level folders. When you select a folder in the sidebar, all of the snippets in that folder, as well as in its subfolders, will be displayed in the second column.

## Creating a folder

To create a folder, there are three methods, which are listed below:

- Select **"File"** > **"New Folder"** from the menu bar.
- Click **"+"** button opposite **"FOLDERS"** in the library to create a new folder.
- Press <kbd>Shift+Cmd+N</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Shift+Ctrl+N</kbd> on Windows or Linux.

## Moving Folders

Drag and drop the required folder onto another folder.

## Renaming and Deleting

Bring up the context menu by right-clicking on the folder and selecting **"Rename"** or **"Delete"**.

::: WARNING 
Deleting the folder will cause all snippets in it, as well as in all sub-folders, to move to **"Trash"**.

## Set the Default Folder Language

Bring up the context menu by right-clicking on the folder and select **"Default Language"**.
