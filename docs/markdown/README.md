## Image Embedding

massCode v3.1 and above supports embedding images.

Follow one of the following steps:

- Copy the image file on your computer and paste it directly into the editor
- Specify the path to the image `![]('./assets/path-to-image.png')`

::: warning
When manually inserting an image, the image must first be copied to the `/assets` folder where the [storage](/essentials/storage.html) is located.


:::

## Mermaid Diagrams

massCode v2.7 and above supports Mermaid, which is a way to create various diagrams and visualizations with code.

> To learn more about the syntax, please refer to [Mermaid documentations](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/?id=diagram-types).


### Use

````markdown
```mermaid
flowchart LR
A[Hard] -->|Text| B(Round)
B --> C{Decision}
C -->|One| D[Result 1]
C -->|Two| E[Result 2]
```
````


<img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/mermaid-demo.png')"></img>

## Render Code Blocks

massCode v3.2 and above.

You can choose what you want the code blocks to be rendered with.

There are two choices: [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) and [Codemirror](https://codemirror.net/5/) (this editor is the basis of massCode).

If you use Codemirror as rendering for code blocks you will get a 1:1 match with how the syntax is highlighted in massCode. When you do this, you need to specify the language for the blocks according to the [values](https://github.com/massCodeIO/massCode/blob/master/src/renderer/components/editor/languages.ts) that the editor itself uses. For example `javascript` instead of `js`.
