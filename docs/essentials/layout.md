# Layout

massCode has an easy to use, three-column interface. This design maximises efficiency and the amount of relevant content you can view at once. 

<img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/preview-app.png')">

## First Column

The first column displays the application library. The application library houses all of the directories for your snippets and subfolders.

## Second Column

The second column displays all of the snippets in the selected location. 

## Third Column

The last (but not least) column is the editor pane. This is most crucial part of the app and is where you will edit your snippets in, add tags and create fragments.
