# Folders

massCode allows you to organize your snippets into multi-level folders. When you select a sidebar folder, all snippets in that folder, as well as in all subfolders, will be displayed in the second column.

## Adding a folder

Follow one of the following steps:

- Select **"File"** > **"New Folder"** from the menu bar.
- Click **"+"** button opposite **"FOLDERS"** in the library to add a new folder.
- Press <kbd>Shift+Cmd+N</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Shift+Ctrl+N</kbd> on Windows or Linux.

## Moving to folder

Drag and drop the required folder to another folder.

## Renaming and Deleting

Call the context menu by right-clicking on the folder and selecting **"Rename"** or **"Delete"**.

> Deleting the folder will cause all snippets in it, as well as in all sub-folders, to move to **"Inbox"**.

## Set the Default Folder Language

Call the context menu by right-clicking on the folder and select **"Default Language"**.
