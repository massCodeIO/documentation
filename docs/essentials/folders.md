# Folders

massCode allows you to organize your snippets into multi-level folders. When you select a folder in the sidebar, all snippets in that folder, as well as in all subfolders, will be displayed in the second column.

## Adding a Folder

To create a new folder, use one of the following methods:

- Select **File** > **New Folder** from the menu bar.
- Click **+** button opposite **FOLDERS** in the library to add a new folder.
- Press <kbd>Shift+Cmd+N</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Shift+Ctrl+N</kbd> on Windows or Linux.

## Moving a Folder

Drag and drop a folder onto another folder to relocate it.

## Renaming and Deleting Folders

Bring up the context menu by right-clicking on the folder and selecting **Rename** or **Delete**.

::: WARNING
Deleting a folder will cause all of its contents, including snippets, fragments and subfolders within it. Deleted snippets can be recovered through the **Trash**.

## Setting a Default Folder Language

Bring up the context menu by right-clicking on the folder and then select **Default Language**.
